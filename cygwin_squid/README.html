<u><h3>Setting Up <a href=http://www.squid-cache.org/>Squid HTML Proxy</a> under
    <a href=https://cygwin.com/>Cygwin</a> to Split Browser Traffic</h3></u>

<p>You can of course change the various scripts in this folder as you see fit. In fact,
you definitely will need to inspect them to understand what is going on here. And
follow some of the web links. The instructions are very brief.
    
<p>Here are the contents of this folder for reference:

<pre>
C:\bat\cygwin_squid>dir /B
Command Line Options - Mozilla MDN.URL
Cygwin Installation.URL
Cygwin.URL
cygwin_install.bat

</pre>

<p>Here are the steps to set this up (run a ".bat" by double-clicking):
<ol>

<li>Run <b><code>cygwin_installer_download.bat</code></b> to download the
<a href=https://cygwin.com/install.html target=_blank>Cygwin 32-bit installer</a>,
<a href=https://cygwin.com/setup-x86.exe download><code>setup-x86.exe</code></a>.
<p>

<li>Now that we have the installer, install the necessary Cygwin packages to run squid by running
<b><code>cygwin_install.bat</code></b>.
<p>
Just keep pressing the "Next" button. Except that you will have to select a mirror site. University sites are usually good.

<li>Now start the OpenVPN tunnel.<p>

<li><u>This step relies on there being a "128.0.0.0/128.0.0.0"
routing table entry</u>, which OpenVPN will install if left to its default behaviour
(<a href=https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/Openvpn23ManPage target=_blank>"<code>redirect-gateway def1</code>"</a>). 
<p>
With the OpenVPN tunnel running, run <b><code>squid_setup_VPN.bat</code></b> to create the squid configuration file
<code>squid.conf</code>, (in the same folder).
<p>Lines similar to these will be put in front of the standard Cygwin squid configuration file:
<pre>

tcp_outgoing_address 10.4.??.??

dns_nameservers 10.4.0.1

http_port 127.0.0.1:3128
acl localnet src 127.0.0.1
http_access allow localnet

# below copied from /etc/squid/squid.conf

</pre>
<p>
In order to determine the values to be used for <code>tcp_outgoing_address</code> and <code>dns_nameservers</code>,
<code>squid_setup_VPN.bat</code> scans the output of "<code>route print</code>", for the "128.0.0.0/128.0.0.0"
routing table entry. If there is a problem with this,
you will have to specify values for <code>tcp_outgoing_address</code> and <code>dns_nameservers</code>
in <code>squid.conf</code> youself (or fix <code>squid_setup_VPN.bat</code> yourself.)

<li>To start squid run <b><code>squid_start.bat</code></b>. There will be <u>no minimized window</u> or anything.
You will just have squid running in the background.

<p>To see the status of squid run <b><code>squid_status.bat</code></b>. This just shows all running
Cygwin processes. Just look for "squid" in the output.

<p>To stop squid run <b><code>squid_stop.bat</code></b>. It may take several seconds for suid to stop,
even when you ry to shut down Windows. I suggest that you stop it first.
You can keep running <b><code>squid_status.bat</code></b> in order to be sure it is gone.

<li>You can <u>create shortcuts</u> to <code>squid_setup_VPN.bat</code>, <code>squid_start.bat</code>,
<code>squid_status.bat</code> and <code>squid_stop.bat</code>
by running <b><code>squid_shortcuts_setup.bat</code></b>. These shortcuts can then be moved or copied
somewhere more convenient.
<p>

<li>You will need to <u>set up your browser to use the squid HTML proxy</u> now available at 127.0.0.1:3128.
<p>
For Firefox you can do this using the "Open menu" icon in the upper right corner.
Select "Options" there and then "Advanced/Network/Connection/Settings".
In that property page select "Manual proxy configuration" and "Use this proxy server for all protocols". And
fill in "localhost" for "HTTP Proxy" with "3128" for "Port".
<p>

<li>If you want to be able to <u>browse through the VPN at the same time as you browse normally</u>,
again with Firefox, you can set up a separate profile just for browsing through squid.

<p>If you have installed Firefox in the default location, you should be able to <u>launch the Firefox profile
manager</u> by running  <b><code>firefox_profile_manager.bat</code></b>. Or create a shortcut with a command line
as in that file.

<p>If you create a profile called "squid_VPN_tester" you can
 <u>launch Firefox with the "squid_VPN_tester" profile</u> using
<b><code>firefox_with_squid_VPN_tester_profile.bat</code></b>.  Or create a shortcut with a command line
as in that file.

<p>As a quick and dirty way to set up a profile named "squid_VPN_tester" with its profile
folder as "<code>profile_squid_VPN_tester</code>" within the current you can run
"<b><code>firefox_create_profile.bat</code></b>". Remember to remove it later with
the Profile Manager.
